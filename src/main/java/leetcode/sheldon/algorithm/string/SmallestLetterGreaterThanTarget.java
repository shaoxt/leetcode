/**
 * Given a list of sorted characters letters containing only lowercase letters, and given a target letter target, find the smallest element in the list that is larger than the given target.

 Letters also wrap around. For example, if the target is target = 'z' and letters = ['a', 'b'], the answer is 'a'.

 Examples:
 Input:
 letters = ["c", "f", "j"]
 target = "a"
 Output: "c"

 Input:
 letters = ["c", "f", "j"]
 target = "c"
 Output: "f"

 Input:
 letters = ["c", "f", "j"]
 target = "d"
 Output: "f"

 Input:
 letters = ["c", "f", "j"]
 target = "g"
 Output: "j"

 Input:
 letters = ["c", "f", "j"]
 target = "j"
 Output: "c"

 Input:
 letters = ["c", "f", "j"]
 target = "k"
 Output: "c"
 Note:
 letters has a length in range [2, 10000].
 letters consists of lowercase letters, and contains at least 2 unique letters.
 target is a lowercase letter.
